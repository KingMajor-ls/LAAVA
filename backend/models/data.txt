Steps on how to plough tomato (sesotho translation: lintlha ha u lema tamati or mekhoa ea ho lema tamati or ke lema tamati joang):

 1.   Soil Preparation( sesotho translation:tukiso ea mobu):
      
        Begin by preparing the soil. Tomato plants thrive in well-drained soil rich in organic matter. Use a plow or tiller to break up the soil and remove any debris.

 2.   Choose a Suitable Variety(sesotho translation: khetha tamati e loketsoeng ke boemo ba maholimo ho uena, etsetsa +26659191302 ho tseba ea hau):
        Select a tomato variety that suits your climate and soil conditions. Consider factors such as disease resistance and yield potential.

 3.   Spacing and Rows:
        Plan the spacing and rows for planting. Tomatoes need adequate space for air circulation and sunlight. Typically, rows are spaced about 3 to 4 feet apart, with plants spaced 18 to 36 inches within the rows.

 4.   Create Furrows:
        Use a plow to create furrows or trenches for planting. The furrows should be deep enough to accommodate the tomato seedlings or seeds.

 5.   Add Fertilizer:
        Prior to planting, incorporate well-balanced fertilizer into the soil according to the recommended dosage. This provides essential nutrients for the growing tomato plants.

 6.   Planting:
        Place tomato seedlings or seeds into the furrows at the recommended spacing. If using seedlings, plant them at a depth that covers the roots and part of the stem. Water the plants immediately after planting.

 7.   Mulching:
        Apply a layer of mulch around the tomato plants to retain moisture, suppress weeds, and regulate soil temperature. Mulching helps in maintaining soil health.

 8.   Staking or Caging:
        Depending on the tomato variety, consider staking or caging the plants to provide support as they grow. This helps prevent the plants from sprawling on the ground.

 9.   Watering:
        Ensure consistent and adequate watering, especially during dry periods. Tomatoes need regular moisture for optimal growth and fruit development.

 10.   Pruning and Training:
        As the tomato plants grow, prune the lower branches to improve air circulation and reduce the risk of diseases. Additionally, consider training the plants to grow vertically for better sunlight exposure.

 11.   Disease and Pest Management:
        Monitor the plants regularly for signs of diseases or pests. Implement appropriate measures, such as applying organic pesticides or fungicides, to protect the crop.

 12.   Harvesting:
        Harvest tomatoes when they reach the desired size and color. Use pruning shears or scissors to cut the fruits from the plants, leaving a small portion of the stem attached.

Following these steps can contribute to a successful tomato cultivation in the fields.


Below is the list of tomato diseases and their remedies:

    Tomato Bacterial Spot:
        Cause: Caused by the bacterium Xanthomonas campestris.
        Remedy: Rotate crops, avoid overhead watering, apply copper-based fungicides.

        Remedy: Increase ventilation, avoid overhead watering, apply fungicides containing chlorothalonil or copper.

    Tomato Septoria Leaf Spot:
        Cause: Fungal infection Septoria lycopersici.
        Remedy: Remove infected leaves, avoid overhead watering, apply fungicides containing chlorothalonil or copper.

    Tomato Spider Mites (Two-Spotted Spider Mite):
        Cause: Infestation by spider mites.
        Remedy: Introduce predatory mites, use insecticidal soap or neem oil, maintain humidity levels.

    Tomato Target Spot:
        Cause: Fungal infection Corynespora cassiicola.
        Remedy: Remove infected plant debris, apply fungicides containing chlorothalonil or copper.

    Tomato Yellow Leaf Curl Virus:
        Cause: Viral infection transmitted by whiteflies.
        Remedy: Remove infected plants, control whiteflies with insecticides or insecticidal soap, use virus-resistant varieties.

    Alluvial Soil:
        Fertility Level: Moderate to low fertility.
        Advice:
            Enhance fertility by adding organic matter such as compost or well-rotted manure.
            Implement crop rotation to prevent nutrient depletion.
            Use cover crops to protect the soil and improve its structure.
            Consider irrigation methods to manage water availability, as alluvial soils can be prone to drainage issues.

    Black Soil:
        Fertility Level: High fertility.
        Advice:
            Maintain soil structure by avoiding compaction through practices like no-till farming.
            Use organic mulches to conserve moisture and suppress weed growth.
            Employ balanced fertilization practices, as excessive use of fertilizers can lead to nutrient imbalances.
            Monitor soil moisture levels to ensure optimal conditions for plant growth.

    Clay Soil:
        Fertility Level: Moderate to high fertility, but often poorly drained.
        Advice:
            Improve drainage by incorporating organic matter such as compost or peat moss.
            Avoid working clay soil when it's too wet to prevent compaction.
            Consider using raised beds to improve drainage and aeration.
            Select crops that tolerate clay soil conditions, such as certain varieties of grains, legumes, and root vegetables.

    Red Soil:
        Fertility Level: Moderate fertility.
        Advice:
            Amend soil with organic matter to improve fertility and structure.
            Implement erosion control measures, as red soils are often prone to erosion.
            Use appropriate fertilizers based on soil test results to address nutrient deficiencies.
            Practice conservation tillage to minimize soil disturbance and maintain organic matter levels.



2.1 Growing maize
When planting maize, the following are imperative to consider.
2.1.1 Soil sampling for analysis
In order to improve the productivity, all soil chemical limita-
tions can be determined effectively by soil sampling and labora-
tory analyses for nutrients. Sampling should be done two
months before planting. Extension agents can assist farmers to
take samples.2.1.2 Selecting maize varieties
Varietal choice can have a significant impact on the yield and
quality of the crop, if done accordingly. Cultivars differ from
one another with regard to a variety of characteristics. There-
fore, every cultivar has its own adaptability and yield potential.
These differences between cultivars leave a producer with al-
ternatives that can be utilized fully. The producer should, how-
ever, first verify the reaction of new or foreign cultivars before
abandoning proven cultivars. DAR has done detailed work in
variety screening and recommendation of suitable varieties for
Lesotho conditions. The following are recommend-
ed for white maize varieties; PAN 4M-19, DKC2147, CG4141
and for yellow varieties the following g are recommended
DKC73-72, DKC80-10, DKC61-90 and PAN12.
2.1.3 Seedbed preparation and sowing operation
Maize requires a friable, well aerated, moist, and weed free
seedbed to provide better contact between the seed and the
soil, however, there is no need to prepare an extremely fine
seedbed. The first ploughing should be done with soil inverting
plough so that at least 20-30cm deep soil may become loose.
Disking/or harrowing should follow it. If the soil is too wet or
too dry or the maize seed is planted too deep, seeds will be
slow to emerge or fail to germinate at all. Maize also establishes
very well under a no-tillage system where the stubble is re-
tained from the previous crop, provided the field is relatively
even and kept free from weeds by hand-chipping or spraying
as required. Maize is then sown directly into the standing stub-
ble without the associated costs of ploughing. Maize is not a
drought tolerant crop, so good soil moisture at sowing time is 
required before the crop is planted. It is recommended that
there be at least 30 cm of moist soil throughout the soil
profile before sowing. Planting depth of maize varies from
2 to 5 cm, depending on the soil type and planting date. As
a rule of thumb, planting should be shallower in heavier
soils than in sandy soils.

Maize Planting time: optimal planting season for maize is Spring, which is from September to November.
Tomato Plantig time: optimal planting season for tomato is Spring and Summer, which is from September to January.

Lesotho seasons:
In Lesotho, there are four seasons in a year; summer from December to February,
with January being the warmest month; autumn from March to May;
winter from June to August; and spring from September to November.
